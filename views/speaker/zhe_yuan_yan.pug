  +speakerContent('顏哲淵 執行長', 'CEO Jer Yuan Yan', 'IoT and AI Technology for Home Energy Management System',  'Biography', 'Jeryuan Yan is the Founder & CEO of NextDrive. He is an enthusiastic innovator and entrepreneur who has over 17+ years experience in product planning, business development and management at semiconductor and high-growth technology companies. NextDrive was founded in 2013 as an IoT hardware storage product company in the beginning. After Jeryuan perceived the opportunity of implementing IoT technology in the smart home and energy management field in Japan, he has led NextDrive to transform into the HEMS (Home Energy Management System) platform provider that aims to revolutionize the quality of life.', 'Abstract', 'The history of human civilization will be incomplete without a chapter dedicated to the discovery of electricity. As ubiquitous as electricity is rooted in our lives, how to save energy is without doubt one the most essential problem of our time that demands for an immediate, effective and efficient solution. In the aftermath of the Fukushima Accident in Japan, budget spending has increased on smart meter installment and ZEH (Zero Energy House) subsides at both local and national level, to achieve energy liberation and the wider adoption of distributed energy system. At NextDrive, we are dedicated to providing innovative energy management services through our HEMS (Home Energy Management System) platform that seamlessly integrates hardware, software and cloud server. This keynote speech will focus on how we utilize the latest IoT (Internet of Things) and AI technology, to gather electricity usage-related data from household to commercial settings in realtime. It will also explain how this technological advancement enables us to conduct big data analysis to gain in-depth understanding towards the correlation of electricity consumption and user behaviour, which forms the basis of our home automation solutions and cross-industrial collaboration with our enterprise and university partners in Japan under the new utility paradigm. Two ongoing projects will be used as example to illustrate the actual applications.  One on VPP (Virtual Power Plant) to explain how NextDrive’s solution can be integrated with the smart grid for controlling household energy usage through ADR (Automatic Demand Response). The other example will be about the joint-development project with Kanto-Gakuin University in Japan to monitor the safety of elderlies using big data analysis on electricity data.', '', '', `${ static }/images/speaker_zhe_yuan_yan.jpg`, 'CEO Zhe Yuan Yan')
