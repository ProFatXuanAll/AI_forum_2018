In this talk, I will discuss several issues with regard to building machines that act rationally (MAR). I will first summarize the main characteristics of MAR. After that, I will introduce several recent work in neuroscience and cognitive science on how humans behave rationally. Next, I will discuss how to build MAR using AI particularly machine learning technologies. Finally, I will introduce one of our recent work on paraphrase generation in natural language processing using deep reinforcement learning, which can be viewed as an example of building MAR. In the work, we let the system to learn not only how to act rationally (to generate good paraphrases), but also how to evaluate rationality (evaluate good paraphrases).', '', '', '', '', `${ static }/images/speaker_hang_lee.jpg`, 'Prof. Hang Li')
